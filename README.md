# Testing-Commercial-Real-Estate-Factors
Master Thesis for the MBF at the University of St. Gallen.

I test a set of 21 candidate risk factors on the returns of privately owned commercial real estate
in the US from 1978 to 2018. I use a bottom-up sequential approach to build a linear model
which keeps the risk factors that are important in explaining the cross-section of returns. The
results I find suggest that the most important risk factor is the real estate market risk premium
as it is the candidate which most reduced the mispricing error in the iterations of the approach
I use. I do not find concrete evidence of another important risk factor. In a second part, I attempt
to get a deeper understanding of the real estate market risk premium. I find that the change in
unemployment rate significantly explain the variation of it.
